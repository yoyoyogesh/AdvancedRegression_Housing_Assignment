## General Information
Identified and removed redundant and unnecessary columns from the housing data set.
• Performed data cleaning on housing data set to remove the junk data (Columns having 100% null values and rows
where the entire row is having null values) and the data which is not required for analysis
• Analyzed the variables and their different data types, also performed null value checks for the variables Data Cleaning and Manipulation
• Data quality issues are addressed in the right way (missing value imputation, outlier treatment and other kinds of data redundancies
• Wherever applicable, data is converted to a suitable and convenient format to work with using the right methods for e.g. categorical variables converted into dummy variables in order build the model.
• Splitting into train and test sets is done
• Rescaling is done to optimize the beta coefficients
• Model has been regularized using Ridge and Lasso Regression methods.
